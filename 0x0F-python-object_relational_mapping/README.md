# Python - Object-relational mapping

* Python OOP
* SQL, MySQL, ORM, SQLAlchemy

## Background Context

* In this project, two amazing worlds are linked: Databases and Python!

* The module MySQLdb is used to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

* The module SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

* The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.
